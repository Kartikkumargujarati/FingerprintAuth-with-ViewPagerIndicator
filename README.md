# FingerprintAuth-with-ViewPagerIndicator

This Android application presents a user with a set of images downloaded from Flickr™ public JSON stream after being authenticated with their fingerprint.

The user will be able to swipe between images and use a swipe to refresh pull from the top of the screen to reload a new set of images from Flickr. The application implements Jake Wharton's ViewPagerIndicator to display indicator at the bottom of the view pager.
