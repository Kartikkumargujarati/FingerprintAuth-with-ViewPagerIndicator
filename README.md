# FingerprintAuth-with-ViewPagerIndicator

This Android application presents a user with a set of images downloaded from Flickrâ„¢ public JSON stream after being authenticated with their fingerprint.

The user will be able to swipe between images and use a swipe to refresh pull from the top of the screen to reload a new set of images from Flickr. This application implements Jake Wharton's ViewPagerIndicator to display indicator at the bottom of the view pager and implements Android's Fingerprint Authentication mechanism to verify the fingerprint of the user.
